I like front-end development, particularly web design, so being able to play with HTML and Ruby within a brand new language called Sinatra is super cool! Plus, with a name like Sinatra, it has some coolness embedded. :p

I'm a huge fan of classic animations. I really like this cartoon called [Rhapsody in Pew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLeXQtsohSI) of a Frank Sinatra parody. In fact this was the first time I've learn who Frank Sinatra was.

I’m happy to learn how dynamic web apps are developed and didn’t know how the codes operated to provide such functionality. I’m excited to learn more about Sinatra and Rails to get started. I've always wondered how the coding for complex and dynamic websites operated. I didn't know anything about it or the concept of Model View Controllers. I'd never guess that's how dynamic websites operated. It's simply getting information from a user/client/browser, applying that information, and returning the results from the information in a specific manner. It's amazing!

With MVC, I definitely see the pattern of the controller routes. My confusion lies within the actual actions within the blocks of each route. I'm getting used to the pattern and trying to remember when I should apply the ``` find_by ``` methods and various logics, especially the logics for logging in to the MVC. When working on the labs for Sinatra I try to see how a user will go about the MVC. It's a bit confusing when I'm trying to juggle that with the tests. Oh well, more practice, right? :p

I like to play with the ERB portion of MVC building. As I mentioned, web design is one of my favorite aspects of web development. I guess it stems from my interests and background with visual design. I believe like most of us students, ERB can be a pain in the butt. During various labs, I couldn't pass tests because of a missing ``` % ``` or ``` = ```. Programming can be so high maintenance.

Another fun part of Sinatra is Layout and Yield! It defintely saves a lot of time when building the views pages. I'm so glad that it's available to us. I'll be using this for sure with my project. 

Nested hashes with Sinatra is very interesting. The fact that hashes can make creating and searching for objects such a breeze. It can be difficult with maintaining the certain hash and its keys. I have an idea set for my portfolio project and hope the way I apply the nested hash goes well. Same goes for the relationships/associations between various classes and controls. Who knew how much databases gets involved with MVC. While learning about SQL, I thought we would be working a lot on databases using its language. I'm glad we somewhat stepped away from that by having Rack do most of the work for us. At least that's what I think is happening... This way we can focus mainly on the Ruby and ActiveRecord relationships.

There's more practice to do with Sinatra and I hope my portfolio project will help with it. Though I had a great practice session with a fellow student on the Pig Latinizer lab. We reached out to one another after attending a study group. It was super helpful. We were able to get our labs done within a few hours. During this session we helped each other with the concept of regex as that was a big piece to passing the lab. There were other areas, too, with the logic of certain methods. I think it's very helpful to learn with a fellow student. It gives us more practice and exposure to how others operate with their coding skills and how their strategies of solving tests. Like this experience, I hope to have future practice group sessions with students where we can finish a lab within a day, best if within a few hours. I have a bad habit of trying to solve many challenges without breaks. I only step away if I get hungry, sleepy, or am pulled away from my computer. If you're that kind of person, maybe we can work on future labs together! :p

Anyone else liking Sinatra? Are there areas you find easy or tough? Let me know how you go about building MVCs. Maybe you're seeing a different pattern that I'm not seeing.
